# temperatureConversion

# Overview
This is a python program designed to convert temperature. This is a variation of an assignment for a college Python course. The course was designed to teach sdtudents the basics of programming through Python. It will convert Celcius to Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit to Celcius. Comments are located at the top of the program. These comments denote the name, author's name, and purpose of the program. They do not effect the program's ability to run in any way.

# Variables
The program will ask the user to enter a temperature. This is an integer value becasuse we want to start with a temperature value without decimal points. Next, the program will ask the user if the temperature is in Celcius or Fahrenheit. The name of this variable is simply "variable." This is inputted as a string because we want the precise temperature value to include decimal places.

# If Statements
This part of the program is comprised of one if statement and two if else statements. The if statement will excecute if the user enters F (for fahrenheit). Next, a variable named "degrees1" is set equal to the temperature in Celcius. To convert the temperature from fahrenheit to celcius, subtract thirty two from the value and then multiply it by 5/9. A print statement will then let the user know their inputted temperatrure and its conversion. The next part of the program is an elif statement. The elif statement will excecute if the user enters C (for Celcius). The variable "degrees2" is created and set equal to the conversion of the "degrees" variable from Celcius to Fahrenheit. A print statement letting the user know their inputted value and the conversion is located on the next line. The final elif statement will excecute when the user does not enter C or F. A print statement will let the user know that they must enter C or F.
